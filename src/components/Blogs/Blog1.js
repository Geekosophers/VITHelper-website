        <h1>Hostel Vacating Procedure</h1>
        <p>If you are leaving for PAT Internship and need to know all the required formalities then this blog is for you.</p>
        <p>I got my internship inquiry call from PAT office on 9th January while I was in VIT doing my final semester Capstone project. They inquired about my availability for an internship in the same company where I had the full time offer I received in July during campus placements. I accepted the offer and on 13th January I got the confirmation mail from the company with all joining details.</p>
        <p>I had only two working days for completing all the formalities before leaving VIT. The processes were</p>
        <p>1. Hostel Vacation</p>
        <p>2. Bonafide Certificate (also called, NOC- No objection Certificate)</p>
        <p>3. Getting my name removed from capstone project list to be processed under PAT.</p>
        <p>Since I had a hard time in managing to get them on time, I decided to explain the entire procedure through this blog.</p>
        <h2>Steps to get Bonafide Certificate-</h2>
        <p>1. Go to the school office with a letter asking for the bonafide certificate.</p>
        <div className={"portfolio-box-layout__box"}>

        </div>
        <p>2. Make sure to mention any company specific details in the certificate like joining and end date. Also communicate the same while handing the letter to the school office.</p>
        <p><b>Note-</b> A friend of mine in SITE was asked to give the Zeroth review(form) again with the letter in order to transfer his name from capstone project to PAT internship.</p>
