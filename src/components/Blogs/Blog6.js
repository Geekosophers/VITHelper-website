              VIT is an institution with a wide range of facilities and
              infrastructure, one of the finest institutions one could ask for.
              The college possesses a universal ambiance suitable for both
              faculties and students coming from different realms for research
              and studies. Smart classrooms are designed in such a way so that
              students can make use of ample resources at the click of a button,
              the library also has wide collections of books, journals, and
              other resources of various subjects. Online students do not get to
              enjoy and utilize the wide facilities the University provides its
              students. Being engineering students, practical knowledge on
              handling different types of equipment and gaining exposure to
              various other laboratory work is highly essential, which is
              confined to students due to online classes despite the university
              providing fully furnished and equipped labs. Socializing and
              networking are skills one needs to master during college life.
              Online classes hinder interaction with faculty and college-mates,
              though students connect through WhatsApp, Instagram, and other
              social media platforms, it does not match that of physical
              interaction.{" "}

              Offline exams are one step ahead of online exams because all you
              need to do is prepare, reach out to the exam hall, and give your
              exam while online exams on the other hand prove to be challenging
              as they involve unexpected server crashes, multiple logins, and
              uploading of answer scripts which are a tiresome process. Online
              classes also have an impact on overall health, and continuous
              gazing at the monitor for a long time ends up in eye strain and
              headache.{" "}

              But just as how a coin has two sides, online classes also provide
              beneficiaries for the students. They can attend classes from their
              comfort zone and get access to recorded sessions if they fail to
              attend the live classes, which is not possible during offline
              lectures. Students also get time to explore various other niches
              and enhance the skills required for their place of interest.
              Lastly, be it online or offline, seniors of VIT have always proved
              to be super cool and help each of their juniors.

              VIT Hostel titled ‘Home away from Home’ provides a comfortable and
              secure atmosphere. Interacting with diverse populations and
              cultures encourages students to develop leadership skills. Hostels
              play a crucial role as students step out from the protective and
              spoon-fed parental atmosphere and learn to make decisions on their
              own. Hostel reviews meetings are conducted every fortnight by the
              Hostel Administrators to meet student requirements. Wardens are
              available 24x7 to support the students. The hostel rooms and
              bathrooms are cleaned every essential day. Hostel wardens are
              friendly and equally strict timekeepers. Once you join
              VITHostel(especially freshers), you’ll be obsessed with these
              picturesque views from the windows  (F, N, M, P BLOCKS).

              It takes a small amount of effort to adjust with roommates, and
              once that is done, the hostel life is going to be memorable. Being
              in the<b> ‘away from parents’</b> phase, life in a hostel teaches
              the <b>AID </b>of<b> </b>life:
              <b>A</b>cclimatization, <b>I</b>ndependence, and <b>D</b>
              ecisiveness.

              Now, you tell me, ain’t you missing the college vibe? Though
              online classes are cost-friendly and provide space for
              asynchronous learning; the exposure and network, one gains through
              offline classes are a cut above. Eyes are the best cameras
              capturing moments with emotion, creating memories, and college
              life play a vital role in this. See you all soon on the campus.
               Also, don’t forget to follow the Covid protocols as the pandemic
              has not come to an end yet.
